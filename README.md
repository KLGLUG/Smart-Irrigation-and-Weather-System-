# Smart-Irrigation-and-Weather-System-
###Project Idea:
To make an automated system that can determine the moisture level in the soil,temperature,humidity in the atmosphere and can determine the water-level in the tank to facilitate irrigation monitoring.
###Apparatus Used:
We use the open hardware platform “ARDUINO” and also the respective sensors. The sensors used in this automation are DHT11 sensor for monitoring the temperature and humidity, Moisture sensor, Ultrasonic sensor to determine water-level in the tank.
###Procedure:
1.Do connect the sensors with respect to their input type onto the pins of the Arduino uno board.
2.Dump the code as uploaded using the ide onto the micro controller.
3.For different climatic conditions check the working of your monitoring system.
